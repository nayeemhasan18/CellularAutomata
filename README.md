# CellularAutomata
Cellular Automata are a fascinating area of computing science. The basic idea is to take some 2 or 3 dimensional space and break it up into a grid, with each square or cube in the space being a cell. Each cell has a state or a number of states that evolve over time. How these states evolve depends on the states of neighbouring cells and a set of rules relating them. Perhaps the most famous example of Cellular Automata is the game of Life, developed by John Conway and first published in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column in the October 1970 and February 1971 issues of Scientific American.
